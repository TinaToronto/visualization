# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      Your answer...
      [Answer]
       1. Good public data visualizations online (https://public.tableau.com/app/discover) is "OECD Better Life Index and World Happiness Index". 
          a.  This visualization employs a petal circle chart to compare these two indices for 20 countries.
          b.  This visualization is offering a clear, intuitive visual relationship.
          c.  It effectively uses design principles to emphasize key data points without overwhelming the viewer.

        2. Bad public data visualizations online (https://public.tableau.com/app/discover) is "Bad Dashboard Example".
           a. The dashboard crams too much information into a single view, making it difficult for users to focus on key insights.
           b. Colors are applied inconsistently, creating confusion rather than clarity.
           c. Some graphs and metrics lack clear labels or legends, making it challenging for viewers to interpret the data accurately.
           d. The inclusion of unnecessary elements clutters the visual, detracting from its purpose.

    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Your answer...
      [Answer]
       1. Simplify the layout
          Focus on a single story or insight per dashboard. Use separate tabs or sections for different data themes to avoid overwhelming the audience.

       2. Streamline color usage
           Use a minimal and consistent color palette that aligns with the dashboard's purpose, such as applying one color per category or metric.

       3.  Improve labeling
           Ensure that every chart and graph includes precise titles and annotations to explain the data. Avoid jargon or overly technical terms.

       4.  Reduce redundancy
           Consolidate metrics into fewer but more meaningful charts, such as replacing redundant pie charts with a single bar chart showing comparison.

       5.  Enhance visual hierarchy
           Emphasize critical metrics or insights using larger text, bolder colors, or strategic positioning. Use white space effectively to separate distinct sections.
    
        6. Focus on the end user
           Define the primary audience and tailor the visualization to their needs. Include filters and interactive features to allow users to explore the data intuitively.

      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
